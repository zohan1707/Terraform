# Terraform
Terraform. Create ec2 instance in AWS

This is my firs Terraform project.

In order to run, you need to use the following commands :

1. terraform init

THE TERRAFORM INIT COMMAND INITIALIZES A WORKING DIRECTORY CONTAINING TERRAFORM CONFIGURATION FILES. THIS IS THE FIRST COMMAND THAT SHOULD BE RUN AFTER WRITING A NEW TERRAFORM CONFIGURATION OR CLONING AN EXISTING ONE FROM VERSION CONTROL. IT IS SAFE TO RUN THIS COMMAND MULTIPLE TIMES.


2. terraform plan

THE TERRAFORM PLAN COMMAND CREATES AN EXECUTION PLAN, WHICH LETS YOU PREVIEW THE CHANGES THAT TERRAFORM PLANS TO MAKE TO YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE. BY DEFAULT, WHEN TERRAFORM CREATES A PLAN IT:

READS THE CURRENT STATE OF ANY ALREADY-EXISTING REMOTE OBJECTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TERRAFORM STATE IS UP-TO-DATE.
COMPARES THE CURRENT CONFIGURATION TO THE PRIOR STATE AND NOTING ANY DIFFERENCES.
PROPOSES A SET OF CHANGE ACTIONS THAT SHOULD, IF APPLIED, MAKE THE REMOTE OBJECTS MATCH THE CONFIGURATION.


3. terraform apply

THE TERRAFORM APPLY COMMAND EXECUTES THE ACTIONS PROPOSED IN A TERRAFORM PLAN.


4. terraform destroy

THE TERRAFORM DESTROY COMMAND IS A CONVENIENT WAY TO DESTROY ALL REMOTE OBJECTS MANAGED BY A PARTICULAR TERRAFORM CONFIGURATION.
